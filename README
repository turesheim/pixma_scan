Introduction
============

This is a driver for the Canon Pixma MP7x0 scanner, which has been developed
by sniffing and analysing the Windows driver's communication.  It is far from
perfect, but after all, it supports among other things these basic features:

- all resolutions: 75/150/300/600/... dpi
- user defined image offsets and sizes
- ADF and flatbed
- calibration
- reset / recovery on errors
- basic status handling and
- things I might have forgotten :)

If you have a Pixma scanner other than 7x0, you should consider contacting me.
It is pretty simple to check if your scanner uses a similar protocol and maybe
your model could be integrated smoothly by just adding another USB product ID.


Compatibility
=============

MP730/750/760/780: supported
MP150/170/450/500: work in progress
MP800/830        : unknown
MP110/130        : looks incompatible


Installation
============

$ make
$ sudo make install


Test
====

$ sudo make test


Usage
=====

The image acquisition tool is called pixma_scan and must be run as root.  You
will get a short help message if you run it without any argument.


Example
=======

$ sudo pixma_scan -r 150 -x 60 -y 10 -w 800 -h 580 -o test.pnm


Credits
=======

A little late I noticed some similarities between the protocol of the CanoScan
parallel scanners and the Pixma USB scanner.  Sometimes the code of the
sane-backend canon_pp was helpful to clarify things.

Thanks to Jose Juan Iglesias Rebollo, Farvil and Wittawat Yamwong for helping
with devices I do not own (MP450 and MP150).  BTW:  Wittawat has written his own
driver for the MP150, which will probably be officially released by him soon.
