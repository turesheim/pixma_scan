Ugly:
- avoid a bus reset if possible

Stability and portability:
- integrate timeouts in some whiles to eliminate the chance of an infinite loop
- much more error handling (malloc, fopen, usb_* etc.)
- check endianess
- checksum tests for answer buffers

Features:
- support scanning multiple pages with the ADF at once
- support the two copy buttons (simple, see SCRATCH)

Clarify:
- which resolutions are really supported?
- why does d420 sometimes return 0x20 instead of 0x38 to signal the last packet?
- what does eb80 effect (see SCRATCH)?
- is e90200010 calibration related?
